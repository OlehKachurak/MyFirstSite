            <p>As a result of Covid-19 you may be required to complete and present additional travel documentation before<br>
             you travel. Please ensure you check the most up to date travel restrictions and country-specific requirements<br>
              before you fly.
            </p>  

             <p>Failure to present any mandatory documentation will result in your travel being denied by local authorities.</p>
           <b>Please also note:</b> 
           <ul>
               <li>It is mandatory to wear a face mask/covering at all times in the airport and on board your flight. Some<br>
                 countries require passengers to wear surgical face masks at the airport and on-board the aircraft. It is<br>
                 your responsibility to check local requirements before travelling.
               </li>
               <li>
                You may also be required to have your temperature checked at the airport, prior to security.
               </li>
               <li>
                If you do not pass this temperature check you will not be permitted to travel on public health grounds. 
               </li>  
           </ul> 
           <p>Failure to comply with these measures will result in passengers not being permitted to travel on public health<br>
            grounds.
           </p>
            <p>As a result of Covid-19 you may be asked to adhere to the advice of your government in relation to an<br>
             imposed quarantine period depending on the country of travel. Please note that a government imposed advice<br>
             on quarantine period will not result in the flight being cancelled and an automatic entitlement to refunds
